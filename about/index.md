## About Me

I am the Build & Deployment manager at 15below having worked my way through different roles in the company.

I started as part of the support team during a placement year in my software engineering degree from the university of Brighton. I later moved into the development team. Once part of the development team I became one of the senior members of the team, leading and mentoring others.

I am now the owner of the build and deployment process in the company liaising with various business areas to facilitate an efficient and stable platform to deliver quality software to our customers.

I've had the pleasure of working with many exciting people in the travel industry as well as within the IT industry due to the nature of my work at 15below.

My love of coding has lead me to create a few open source code projects which can be found on my GitHub. These include the bing background image downloader (for desktop wallpapers), the secret santa helper/emailer & my latest and most popular app called Gallifrey.

Gallifrey is an helper for the Atlassian Jira product where you can use an array of stopwatches to time how long tasks take, then export this as a time sheet into Jira. Gallifrey is used by many people across 4 continents, and I'm very proud of this achievement. The product continues to grow and gain downloads on the Atlassian marketplace.

I am an avid Brighton & Hove Albion supporter and have been since i was 5.
