## About Me

### My Career

I am the Build & Deployment manager at 15below having worked my way through different roles in the company.

I started as part of the support team during a placement year in my software engineering degree from the university of Brighton. I later moved into the development team. Once part of the development team I became one of the senior members of the team, leading and mentoring others.

I am now the owner of the build and deployment process in the company liaising with various business areas to facilitate an efficient and stable platform to deliver quality software to our customers.

I've had the pleasure of working with many exciting people in the travel industry as well as within the IT industry due to the nature of my work at 15below.

### Love Of Coding

My love of coding has lead me to create a few open source code projects which can be found on my GitHub. These can be found [on my software page]({{ site.url }}/software/mine).

I am a huge believer in open source software being the future and will strive to ensure that all software is open to everyone.

### Personal Life

I am an avid Brighton & Hove Albion supporter and have been since I was 5.

This means I was around in the "war years" seeing the last season and a half at the Goldstone Ground, travlling to Gillingham for the 2 seasons in exile.
The 12 years at the Withdean and now the amazing American Express community stadium.
