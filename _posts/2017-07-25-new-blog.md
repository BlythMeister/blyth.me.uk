Introducing my new blog designed by myself (no nasty templates!) and hosted in GitHub Pages

My old Wordpress blog is [here](https://blythmeister.wordpress.com/) and over the comming days I will be migrating selected posts here with their original publish dates & updating the WordPress site to link here, so watch this space.

The site is almost complete, there are still a few things I need to update such as:

- Content updates
- Custom 404 page
- Social shares on posts
- Auto tweet from my twitter on new posts
- Custom domain
- Cloudflare/SSL
- Maybe more things...
