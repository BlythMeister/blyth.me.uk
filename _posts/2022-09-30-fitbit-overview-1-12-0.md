## Details

Version 1.12.0 of the [Fitbit overview watch face](https://gallery.Fitbit.com/details/7c4f7506-8ed8-4eb9-84e3-28b85671f26b) has been released and is available now.

## What's New

This release only makes changes to the Versa 3 & Sense watch faces.

In this release the double tap area to turn on the "always on" or "torch mode" has been reduced to just the clock part.

It's now possible to add the weather location to your watch as well as the weather, but the location can only be shown in the bottom middle position.

Finally, more changes have been made to try and make app to watch communication more stable, this includes automatically restarting the clock face when communication has been broken for over 10 minutes
