## Background

I've been interested in smart watches for a while now and in the past have attempted to create watch faces and apps for the Pebble.

At the beginning of the year I invested in a Fitbit & started looking for a stats heavy watch face that looked nice and showed progress towards goals.

I came across [ANDv2](https://github.com/ahsandar/ANDv2) and whilst it had a lot of the features I was looking for, there were some annoyances with it.

At 1st I raised a couple of issues on GitHub & then tried to reach out to the repository maintainer but was unable to get contact, so I set to work on making my own version of ANDv2.

## Introducing Overview

Overview is my fully [open source](https://github.com/BlythMeister/Fitbit-Overview-Face) and actively maintained stats heavy Fitbit watch face.

The watch face is published into the [Fitbit gallery](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/7c4f7506-8ed8-4eb9-84e3-28b85671f26b) so is easy to download and install onto  your watch.
Or you can use the handy QR code

It supports all 3 Fitbit customisable watches (Ionic, Versa & Versa Lite) and comes jam packed with customisable options.

The features include:

* 12/24 hour clock support
* AM/PM optional display on 12 hour clock
* Optional show/hide of seconds
* Date with day name
* Heartrate with optional animation & zone display
* Steps
* Distance
* Calories
* Floors
* Active Minutes
* BMI & BMR
* Progress bars for activity goals
* Battery bar along the top

It also has support for the following languages:

* English
* French
* Italian
* German
* Spanish
* Japanese
* Korean
* Chinese (Simplified)
* Chinese (Traditional)

## Cost

What's best is Overview is completely free to use!

## What Next?

I really hope that my watch face gathers some users who suggest additional features, so far, the only request I have had is to add weather information but would be really interested to hear more ideas.
