## Details

Version 1.11.0 of the [FitBit overview watch face](https://gallery.fitbit.com/details/7c4f7506-8ed8-4eb9-84e3-28b85671f26b) has been released and is available now.

## What's New

### Versa 3 & Sense

With version 1.11.0 the long awaited support for the current weather has been added and can be included in the "stats" section.

This version also sees a change to the "no progress bar" option with an increase in font size as there is greater space on the screen for large font.

The settings page has had a layout change to try and make it flow better.

### Versa, Versa Lite & Versa 2

These models have been moved into the "deprecated" version as FitBit are no longer producing new versions.

However, bug fixes and things that are easy to backport from the newer devices will still be released.

Version 1.11.0 fixes a bug introduced in 1.10.0 that prevented settings from being set when changed on the mobile device.

The change to settings has been back ported so these devices benefit from that.
