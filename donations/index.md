### Why Donate

Why do i even have this page for donations? - I have listed a few reasons as to why donations are so useful.

* Donations are a great way to sponsor future development on existing or new products.
* Donations help with the ongoing running costs of existing platforms.
* Most of the software I publish is completely free to use but has taken a lot of time to create. - A small "thank you" donation for a cup of coffee goes a long way :)
