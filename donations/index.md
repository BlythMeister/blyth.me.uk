## Donations

### Why Donate

Why do i even have this page for donations? - I have listed a few reasons as to why donations are so useful.

* Donations are a great way to sponsor future development on existing or new products.
* Donations help with the ongoing running costs of existing platforms.
* Most of the software I publish is completely free to use but has taken a lot of time to create. - A small "thank you" donation for a cup of coffee goes a long way :)

### Donation Methods

#### Buy Me A Coffee

I have a [Buy Me A Coffee site](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/blythmeister)

Buy Me A Coffee accepts donations in the denomination of "cups of coffee" priced at Â£3.

You can buy multiple cups if your feeling very generous, or even setup a regular coffee donation!

#### PayPal

I have a [direct PayPal link](https://www.paypal.me/BlythMeister)

This enables any amount to be donated directly into my PayPal account, PayPal also enables you to select the currency of your donation!

#### Monzo

I have a [Monzo account](https://monzo.me/chrisblyth) which I have made available for donations.

I'm not a huge user of Monzo, but it's an easy way to get donations into a format for standard use.
