## Donations

### Donation Methods

I have various different ways to receive donations which include fixed and variable amounts and use a variety of services some of which do not require sign-up.

#### Buy Me A Coffee (£3, £6 or £9)

[Buy Me A Coffee site](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/blythmeister)

Pay for the coffee using PayPal or any credit/debit card.

No sign-up required.

#### PayPal (Variable Amount)

[PayPal link](https://www.paypal.me/BlythMeister)

Requires PayPal account but allows for a donation of any amount in your chosen currency.

#### Credit/Debit Card, Apple Pay & Google Pay (Variable Amount)

There are currently 3 supported currencies:

* [GBP/£](https://donate.stripe.com/4gw9Bzgyh0a03yo8ww)
* [USD/$](https://donate.stripe.com/aEUfZXdm5aOE7OE8wx)
* [EUR/€](https://donate.stripe.com/4gwcNLgyh9KA1qg6oq)

No sign-up and allows for donation of any amount.

_Feel free to contact me for links in a different currency and I can generate a link to add above._

### Why Donate

Why do i even have this page for donations? - I have listed a few reasons as to why donations are so useful.

* Donations are a great way to sponsor future development on existing or new products.
* Donations help with the ongoing running costs of existing platforms.
* Donations means that I know who my users are so can keep you informed of updates.
* Most of the software I publish is completely free to use but has taken a lot of time to create. - A small "thank you" donation for a cup of coffee goes a long way :)

### Donations Not Licences

The donation model offered by my software is not an offer of lifetime support for your single donation.
